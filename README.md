### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- ### First time visitor goals
  
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

            1.Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text which explains purpose of the website.
            2.The User has two options, check venues avelible or go straight to the booking form. Both can be accessed frrom navigation menu and will direct to seperate websites.

    2.As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

            1.The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
            2.On the Booking Page, after a form response is submitted, USer is taken to the confirmation page and then redirected automaticly ato the Home page after 10 seconds.

    3.As a First Time Visitor, I want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

            1.The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.

### Further Testing

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 12 Pro Max & Samsung Galaxy S20
- A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
- Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

- On some mobile devices the Hero Image pushes the size of screen out more than any of the other content on the page. A white gap can be seen to the right of the footer and navigation bar as a result.

- On very wide screens a wide gap can be seen on right and left side. Text goes over the image which makes text unredable.
